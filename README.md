Kill my evil Twin : Research on Rouge wireless access point detection for end users’ devices
==

Solution is proposed with the concept of white-list and central sever for updates. Evaluation of proposed solution will be carried for the set of randomly selected users where the main focus is of the survey to identify the knowledge and the awareness about the wireless networks, internet usage patterns, awareness about public wifi with multiple access points and attacks that can performed in a public wifi environment. Then the users will get a hand-on experience of a prototype tool which is implemented using the proposed solution and taking the feedback of it and evaluate tool using user’s perspective. The next phase is carried out to test too in actual environment and its success rate using three different scenarios. This testing is carried out on selected different public places where mass crowd is seeking for public wifi. (Airports, Restaurants etc.) in the testing environment, Rouge access point is created and observe and identify the behaviors of the network and users who are connected to rouge access point and analyze whether tool’s performance to capture the rouge access point in selected different scenarios. Analyzing the test result using successive rate of the data gathered for each scenario will give a better evaluation to identify the tool’s capacities and limitations. 
In order to enhance the proposed solution, the research focus on the evaluated solutions which are done by previous researches propose a new solution which is feasible and easy to use at client side to reduce the risk of being a victim of evil twin attack.
